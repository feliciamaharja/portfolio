# Project Background
Heicoders Bank, a leading financial institution in Singapore, offers a wide range of banking products, including savings accounts, loans, and credit cards. The GoCard, one of the bank's flagship credit cards, is designed to attract and retain customers through rewards and cashback benefits. In a competitive market where consumers often own multiple cards and switch based on incentives, GoCard's goal is to increase transaction volumes and customer loyalty.

This project focuses on analyzing consumer spending patterns on the GoCard to identify key drivers of transaction activity. By understanding customer preferences, popular spending categories, and transaction behaviors, the objective is to **boost GoCard's transaction volumes and spendings in Q3 2020**. The analysis will provide actionable insights for the Product & Marketing teams to enhance GoCard's appeal in a highly competitive credit card market.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- **Consumer Spending Patterns:** Analysis of transaction data to identify popular spending categories, average transaction sizes, and customer preferences. 
- **Category 2:** 
- **Category 3:**

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
