# Project Background

Heicoders Bank, a leading financial institution in Singapore, offers a wide range of banking products, including savings accounts, loans, and credit cards. The GoCard, one of the bank's flagship credit cards, is designed to attract and retain customers through rewards and cashback benefits. In a competitive market where consumers often own multiple cards and switch based on incentives, GoCard's goal is to increase transaction volumes and customer loyalty. Key business metrics include transaction volume, spending patterns, and customer engagement across different transaction types and categories.

This project focuses on analyzing consumer spending patterns on the GoCard to identify key drivers of transaction activity. By understanding customer preferences, popular spending categories, and transaction behaviors, the objective is to **boost GoCard's transaction volumes and spendings in Q3 2020**. The analysis will provide actionable insights for the Product & Marketing teams to enhance GoCard's appeal in a highly competitive credit card market.


Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- **Customer Spending Trends by Location:** Analysis of transaction data to identify popular spending categories, average transaction sizes, and customer preferences. 
- **Transaction Type Preferences** 
- **Expense Category Analysis**
- **Seasonal Spending Patterns**

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* **Missing Data:** Some transaction dates were imputed or excluded to maintain trend integrity.
  
* **Geographic Analysis:** Incomplete geolocation data may limit full regional insights.
  
* **Limited Demographic Data:** Lack of customer profiles restricts deeper segmentation analysis 
  
* **External Factors:** COVID-19â€™s impact is considered a major external driver, though broader economic indicators weren't available.
